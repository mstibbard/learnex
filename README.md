# Learnex

## Goals
This is a dummy project to try and get myself back up and running in Elixir + Phoenix. It is a learning opportunity and will probably go in weird directions at times as I try to learn new things.

## Desires
At some point it would be great to get a code review from someone that actually knows what they are doing!!

## Requirements
- [x] User restricted to the index page if not logged in
- [x] User can create an account
- [x] User can log in
- [x] Authenticated user can create a provider (e.g. ING Savings)
- [ ] Authenticated user restricted to providers they've created (i.e. other users providers don't appear)
- [ ] Authenticated user can create point in time balances for a provider (e.g. balance of 10,000 in ING Savings on 2020-11-05)
- [ ] Authenticated user restricted to balances they've created (i.e. other users balances don't appear)
- [ ] All above requirements should have passing tests
